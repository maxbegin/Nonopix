      <h1>I Built a Mobile Game in 3 Days Using AI at Every Step</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="article-body">
      <p>I built the core of a nonogram puzzle app in about three days of intensive work. The deployment, store listing, testing, and approval process took longer — but the actual app went from idea to functional in a long weekend. The whole thing started out of curiosity — I wanted to see how far AI could take me on a platform I'd never worked on, and hopefully learn some new things along the way.</p>

      <p>AI was involved at literally every stage. And here's the thing — <strong>I'm not a mobile developer.</strong> My background is console game programming. I had never shipped a mobile app before this. I also didn't write a single line of code myself. Every line was generated by AI. I directed, reviewed, decided, iterated — but I never typed code.</p>

      <h2>The App</h2>

      <p>NonoPix is a daily nonogram puzzle game. No ads, no power-ups, no dark patterns. You get a free puzzle every day, and if you want more, there's a one-time lifetime purchase to unlock an archive of past puzzles. That's it.</p>

      <p>It's intentionally minimalist. Nonograms don't need flashy graphics — it's a grid, some numbers, and your brain. That simplicity is partly what made this possible in three days. But the app still has the stuff you'd expect: weekly themed puzzles, difficulty levels that ramp through the week, achievements, leaderboards, a celebration screen when you solve one, stats tracking.</p>

      <h2>AI at Every Step</h2>

      <p>I'm not exaggerating when I say every step. Ideation, prototyping, backend tooling, deployment, debugging, UI/UX iteration, store listing copy — all of it involved Claude Opus 4.6 in some capacity.</p>

      <p>The workflow that surprised me most was the UI iteration loop. I'd take a screenshot of the app, send it to Claude, and say "this feels off, the spacing is wrong" or "this screen looks too bland" — sometimes with specific complaints, sometimes just letting the AI take full creative freedom. Then I'd get back concrete suggestions with exact values. Colors, padding, typography. Not vague "maybe try making it more vibrant" advice — actual specs I could implement.</p>

      <h2>The Setup</h2>

      <p>Built with Expo/React Native, version controlled on GitHub. One thing that kept the whole project organized: Claude maintained its own todo list as a file in the repo. I didn't manage tasks — the AI tracked what was done, what was next, and what was blocked. I just pointed it in the right direction.</p>

      <p>One thing that kept the momentum going: using Claude Code through the phone app with Happy Coder — a free, open-source tool that lets you remotely control Claude Code from your phone — I could keep working while away from my computer. Waiting for coffee? Fixing a bug. On the couch? Iterating on the main screen layout. That flexibility matters a lot during a compressed build like this.</p>

      <p>The backend runs on Supabase, and Claude managed that too — setting up tables, writing queries, handling the integration. The subscription handling, puzzle generation tooling — AI helped scaffold and debug all of it. When I hit a wall with RevenueCat credentials or Android notification icons getting clipped weird, I wasn't stuck googling for hours. I described the problem, got a direction, and moved on.</p>

      <h2>What I Actually Think</h2>

      <p>This isn't a "AI will replace developers" story. I made every decision. I knew what I wanted the app to feel like, what the business model should be, what was good enough to ship and what wasn't. I just didn't write the code to get there. The AI compressed the time between having an idea and seeing it on screen — and it let me build something on a platform I'd never worked on before. That's the real value.</p>

      <p>Three days for the core is fast. But the app doesn't feel rushed — it feels focused. I actually ended up adding way more features than I planned going in. In-depth stats, a full achievements system, difficulty tiers — stuff I would have cut from scope if I'd been writing it all by hand. The speed of iteration meant I could keep saying "yeah, let's add that too" instead of triaging features out.</p>

      <p>And I think that's the interesting part. <strong>AI didn't lower the bar. It just made it possible to reach the bar I already had in mind, way faster than I could have alone.</strong></p>

      <h2>How I Got Here</h2>

      <p>I started using AI for development at work back in July 2024. Honestly? It wasn't that impressive at first. The outputs were hit or miss, you spent a lot of time correcting things, and it often felt faster to just do it yourself.</p>

      <p>But the models kept getting better, and at some point — I can't pinpoint exactly when — it crossed a threshold. It went from "neat trick" to fundamentally changing how I work. The NonoPix build was a direct result of that shift. A year ago I wouldn't have attempted building a core app in three days like this.</p>

      <h2>What This Means for Games</h2>

      <p>I think game quality is going to go up across the board — and not because AI writes better code than humans. It's because iteration speed changes everything. When you can prototype an idea in hours instead of days, you try more things. You throw away bad ideas faster. You spend more time on the stuff that actually matters: polish, feel, the little details that make a game satisfying.</p>

      <p>Bugfixing and polish — the parts of game dev that are necessary but grueling — get dramatically faster too. That time gets reinvested into making the game better.</p>

      <p>This is a real shift for developers though. Writing code by hand all day is becoming a thing of the past. The job is moving toward ideation, direction, and fast iteration. You're less of a typist and more of a decision-maker. That's a big adjustment, and not everyone's going to love it. But I think the games coming out the other end will be better for it.</p>

      <p>More thoughts coming as I keep iterating on the app.</p>
